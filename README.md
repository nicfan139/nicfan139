# Hi there 👋, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name's Nicolas Fan (but you can call me Nic), and I'm a web developer with 4-5 years of experience.

Although I can do Full-Stack, I definitely prefer working on the Front-End!

I'm primarily a React developer. But I also enjoy building small projects with SvelteKit, and I'm currently sharpening my knowledge with GraphQL.
